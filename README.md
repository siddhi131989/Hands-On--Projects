2. sex
3. chest pain type (4 values)
4. resting blood pressure
5. serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6. fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
7. resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
8. maximum heart rate achieved
9. exercise induced angina
10. oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12. ca- Number of major vessels (0â€“3) colored by flourosopy : displays the value as integer or float.
13. thal : Displays the thalassemia : 1,3 = normal 6 = fixed defect 7 = reversible defect: no proper blood movement when excercising

### Target :
14. target : Displays whether the individual is suffering from heart disease or not : 1 = yes 0 = no
